For PC, put all these files unzipped in a folder, open index.html in your browser of choice and then click the arrows or the numbers on the site to change what the values are
For Mobile, put all these files in a folder that you know where it is, preferably on local storage, then in your browser of choice, type 
file:///storage/emulated/0/DestinationFolder/index.html  if you put it in local storage,
otherwise locate where it is, if the folder name has spaces use %20, (example: Destination%20Folder) or remove the space from the folder name.  (I don't know specifics for certain devices, only for my android)
